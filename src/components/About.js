      <h1>Hi, I'm Sravanthi. I love to build amazing apps.</h1>
      <p>
        My current knowledge in full stack development such as JavaScript, web
        component frameworks and UI technologies helped me to gain easy
        understanding in application process and the related responsibilities. I
        have used Jenkins, Docker and the relevant tools used in continuous
        integration and deployment.
